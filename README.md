# Smart Line Follower Car using ATmega328P

A dual-mode autonomous robot car that follows a black line using IR sensors and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. This project was developed as part of the **Microcontroller Laboratory** during the **2nd Year, 2nd Semester**.

## üöó Project Overview

This smart car operates in two modes:

- **Mode 01 (Line Following):**  
  - Uses 3 IR sensors to follow a calibrated black line.
  - Green LED blinks when this mode is active.

- **Mode 02 (Line Following + Obstacle Detection):**  
  - Follows the line using IR sensors.
  - Ultrasonic sensor checks for obstacles.
  - Car stops if an obstacle is detected.
  - Blue LED blinks when this mode is active.
  - Red LED blinks when an obstacle is detected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Power ON**: Car activates automatically using the 12V battery.
2. **Mode Selection**:
   - Mode 01: Line following only.
   - Mode 02: Line following + obstacle detection.
3. **IR Sensors** detect the line and direct the car.
4. **Ultrasonic Sensor** (in Mode 02) checks for obstacles.
5. LEDs provide visual feedback:
   - üü¢ Green: Mode 01 active
   - üîµ Blue: Mode 02 active
   - üî¥ Red: Obstacle detected
